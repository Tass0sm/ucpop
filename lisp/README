**************** Description 

This version (4.0) has minor bug fixes and some significant enhancements
for the planner - for example inclusion of the PDB planner
visualization/debugging tool.  UCPOP runs on most Lisp systems.  PDB
requires CLIM 2.0.

This minor revision (4.0.6) fixes many loading bugs and some geometry problems
of PDB.  A new implementation of ZLIFO is included,  for details please refer
to ./doc/zlifo.doc.  

**************** Files and loading instructions

This distribution contains the following files:

./README                  : this file
./*.lisp                  : code for UCPOP planner proper.
./ucpop40.system	  : CMU defsystem for ucpop 4.0
./domains/domains.lisp	  : main test domains for ucpop
./domains/truckworld.lisp : truckworld domain.  Using ranking heuristics to 
			    control search.

./domains/processp/*.lisp : domain definition and problems for a large
			     real-world scheduling domain.
			     read processp/p-metal.lisp for details.

If you don't have CMU public domain defsystem library,  you can load UCPOP
by loading the file ./loader.lisp,  and run (load-ucpop) afterwards.  
You can compile the system using (compile-ucpop).  Remember to update
the variable *ucpop-dir* in the file to reflect where you have installed
UCPOP.

If you have CMU defsystem,  just put the file ./ucpop40.system in your
local repository and you can use (load-ucpop) and (compile-ucpop) to
load and compile the system.  Please remember to redefine the source paths in
the defsystem files.

**************** Starting UCPOP

After loading UCPOP via (require 'ucpop) or (load-ucpop), type

(in-package "UCPOP")
(bf-control 'sussman-anomaly)

If you have CLIM 2.0, then from the UCPOP package type

(pdb-setup)

**************** Known Bugs and Workarounds

When compiling ucpop and pdb, Lisp may give warnings about unreferenced
functions. These are bogus - Lisp just couldn't figure out the dependencies
at compile time.

Some users have reported problems using the graphical user interface (PDB)
because other applications have used up all the colormap entries in your X
terminal.  If you get this problem, try to do an xsetroot to remove
background pictures on your xterm if any, or close down some apps that use
up colors.  You can also use the monochrome defaults (which uses only 4 colors)
by (setf *use-colors* nil) *before* loading ucpop.  
There are Lisp workarounds for color problems,  but current it requires
patching the Lisp image,  so we chose not to apply those solutions.

Other behavioral problems of PDB documented in doc/pdb.html.
